# HCC Survival Prediction

The goal of this project was to develop a ML pipeline as part of coursework at Brown University. I created a reduced-feature pipeline to train ML classification models to predict the survival of patients with HCC using the HCC Survival Data Set from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
